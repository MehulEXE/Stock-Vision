### üîπ **Prisha Pednekar**
- Handled initial **data preprocessing**
- Researched model logic and implementation using **GeeksforGeeks** and related sources
- Trained models (**Random Forest, XGBoost, GBM**) and implemented **bagging for Close price prediction**
- Created and structured the **project presentation (PPT)**

### üîπ **Mehul Sinha**
- Cleaned and prepared **OHLCV stock data** for modeling
- Explored **Kaggle notebooks** and backend architectures for model guidance
- Developed a **Random Forest model for High price prediction**
- Integrated **backend and frontend** for full-stack functionality

### üîπ **Pooja Jadhav**
- Designed and developed the **‚ÄúKnow More‚Äù section** of the frontend
- Trained **RF, XGBoost, GBM models** and implemented **bagging** for the section
- Added **news sentiment analysis** and support for lesser-known stocks (e.g., *Suzlon*)
- Deployed and fine-tuned the **Know More** UI experience

## üöÄ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page reloads when changes are made. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the [running tests guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for details.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!  
This command will copy all config files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control.
